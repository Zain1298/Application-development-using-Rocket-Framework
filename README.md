# Application-development-using-Rocket-Framework

We are making Simple Rust Rocket app which will take input from user any number and add it with 100 and after addition send a POST request with html form to the api to show the response.

How it works ?
If you want to add number then just go to the above address bar and after 8000 write /add/number like /add/20 and enter. You will get the result with addition of 100 like 120
