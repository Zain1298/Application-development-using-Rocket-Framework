# Application-development-using-Rocket-Framework

We are making Simple Rust Rocket app which will take input from user any number and add it with 100 and after addition send a POST request with html form to the api to show the response.

How it works ?
If you want to add number then after executing the program click on the link showed on terminal open it on browser and then on the address bar just after 8000 write /add/number like /add/20 and enter. You will get the result with addition of 100 like 120
